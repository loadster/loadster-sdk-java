<!--
  Sample Ant script to run a test by connecting to a remote Loadster Workbench 
  through the API. This makes it easier to run automated load tests as part
  of your build or continuous integration process.

  For this to work, the API has to be running and reachable on the network,
  and you need the correct API key. The scenario path can be obtained by
  right-clicking the scenario in Loadster Workbench.
